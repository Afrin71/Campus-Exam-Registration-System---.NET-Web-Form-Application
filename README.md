Project: Campus Exam Registration System - .NET Web Form Application

This project is a Campus Exam Registration System built with ASP.NET Web Forms. It allows students to register for an on-campus recruitment drive by filling out their personal, academic, and exam-related details. The system ensures data accuracy by using ASP.NET validation controls (RequiredFieldValidator, RangeValidator, RegularExpressionValidator, CustomValidator).
The application validates inputs such as Candidate Name, Roll Number, Date of Birth, College, Domain, Email, Phone Number, Exam Date, Exam Center, and Skill-based Assessments. Candidates must also confirm agreement to the rules and regulations before submitting.
